# 3D Waypoints

This is an example of displaying GUI elements such as Labels in a 3D world,
without relying on viewports. This results in better readability and performance
for use cases such as showing player names.

Some waypoints showcased in the demo will also snap to the window borders when
outside the player's view.

No Sprite3D nodes are used in this demo.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: GLES 2
