# 3D Viewport Scaling for Compatibility Renderer

This demo shows how to scale the 3D viewport rendering without affecting 2D
elements such as the HUD. It also demonstrates how to toggle filtering on a
viewport. This technique can be useful in 2D games as well. For instance, it can
be used to have a "pixel art" viewport for the main game area and a
non-pixel-art viewport for HUD elements.

If you're using the `Forward+` renderer, see ../3d_scaling instead.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: Compatibility
